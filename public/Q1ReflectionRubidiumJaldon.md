#### **List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.**
.
1. Do-while loops - Looping in C++ is similar to JavaScript's looping. In Grade 8, do-while loops were my favorite to use in the project. We also had a few loops exercises wherein I used do-while loops.

2. CSS - I have a good grasp of CSS. This is because I took classes over the summer. I find styling websites interesting, because of the amount of customization options you have at your disposal.

3. If else-statements: I love if-else statements because they're simple and efficient. Their format is almost the exact same as C++ We also had many exercises this school year that helped refresh our memories.

4. Arithmetic Operators - Arithmetic operators are the backbone of a JavaScript code. The syntax for these are similar to C++. Sir Roy lectured on these very well.

5. Markdown - I have a thorough understanding on markdown. Using markdown helps me create assessments like these. We didn't learn this in C++.

#### **List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.**
.

1. Arrays - I have always struggled with arrays, and the same can be said for JS. Even though I think I understand them more now, they're still quite confusing when coding real-time.

2. ParseInt and ParseFloat - I really don't understand when or where to use parseInt and parseFloat. I think it's because I haven't used it much in our exercises.

3. Looping - I still make mistakes with for loops and while loops. I *understand* the loop, but when faced with a problem where I need to use one, I end up not being able to do it.

4. Debugging - I had a really hard time with exercise 7, and that's because a lot of the things there were things I don't remember seeing in our lessons.

5. Functions - I still struggle with the proper syntax. I forget to call on the function after coding it out.
- A lot of the things mentioned are things that should have been established a long time ago (building of classrooms), and some of these are even already in the constitution.

#### **Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.**
.

1. I'll practice. There are many websites online like W3Schools that provide tutorials for things like loops and arrays. I've noticed my coding takes longer because I make careless logic mistakes. I think this means that I should practice my code analysis skills.

#### **In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**

1a. Two of the best ones in my opinion are the "guess the word" game and the "create your own homepage ones", because I think these two really helped expand my knowledge in HTML, JS, and CSS. The former was a fun challenge, and the latter helped me explore.

1b. Two of the least effective were the "feed me my snacks" activity and the "meal price" ones. A lot of the things we had to do for both were basic things I learned in C++, making me feel like I wasn't learning anything new.
